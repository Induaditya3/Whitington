Some programs that I wrote while working through the book on OCaml by the same author.   
The book is called **[OCaml from the Very Beginning](https://ocaml-book.com/)** which is licensed under Creative Commons.   

It is very good book. The thing I like most about this book (and there lots of things to like) is that the author took time to write hints along with complete answers which makes it ideal for self-study.  

Most of the excercises was worked on *utop* (universal top level which is a REPL), so there are only few program files. And anyways, in the first few chapters programs were easy and most importantly short, so my program differed only in minor ways with author's. There was no need to save my programs for reviewing and I just annotated the pdf.
