(*Q4. Now write the inverse function: given a dictionary, return the pair of two lists â€“ the first containing all the keys, and the second containing all the values *)

(*5. Define a function to turn any list of pairs into a dictionary. If duplicate keys are found, the value
associated with the first occurrence of the key should be kept.*)
